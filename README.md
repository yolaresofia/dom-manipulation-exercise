# dom-manipulation-exercise

The purpose of this excercise is to practice the main concepts of *DOM Selectors & Manipulation*
The idea is select the DOM elements in index.html and add style through JavaScript in order to make the page
look as the image called "solution.png".
Remember you can achieve this by setting the style to the element 'line-by-line' or you can declare a CSS class and add it to the element.
Don't hesitate on ping us if you have any question!
HAPPY CODING!
